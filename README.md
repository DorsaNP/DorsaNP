# Hi, I'm Dorsa Najafipanah!

I’m a **Post-Baccalaureate student at the Harvard Quantum Initiative**, **Harvard University**, advised by **Prof. Jennifer Hoffman** in the Department of Physics.  
🔬 My research focuses on **growing quantum materials thin films using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)** and **investigating their properties**. 

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, and exploring new cafes and restaurants on long walks. I also love reading books, watching sitcoms, and spending quiet moments by the water — like sitting at the seaport and listening to the waves. 🌊
