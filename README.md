Hi, I'm Dorsa:)

I’m a Post-Baccalaureate student at the Harvard Quantum Initiative (HQI), Harvard University, advised by Prof. Jennifer Hoffman in the Department of Physics.  
My research focuses on the growth of quantum material thin films using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and the investigation of their fundamental properties.

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, and exploring new cafes and restaurants on long walks. I also love reading books, watching sitcoms, and spending quiet moments by the water, like sitting at the seaport and listening to the waves. 🌊
